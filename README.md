# TCP Congestion Analyser

A network simulation project for analyzing TCP congestion control algorithms using NS-3.

## Project Structure

- `gg.cpp` - Main simulation code
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules for NS-3 and build artifacts

## Requirements

- NS-3 Network Simulator
- C++ compiler
- Python (for visualization scripts)

## Usage

1. Place your simulation files in the NS-3 scratch directory
2. Build and run the simulation
3. Analyze results using the provided scripts

## Notes

This project uses NS-3 as a local dependency. The NS-3 directory is excluded from version control to keep the repository lightweight.
